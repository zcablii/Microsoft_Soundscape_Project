                        Our UCL Systems Engineering Module Team 39 Project, “Artificial
                        Intelligence/Deep Learning with Cortana” has been analysed with respect to legal
                        issues. These legal issues encompass the potential liability, intellectual property
                        rights and data privacy considerations including compliance with the General
                        Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR) in place in the UK since May 2018. What follows
                        is an issue by issue analysis of potential legal issues that our project may involve.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To begin with, the potential legal liability of our student project is closely linked
                        to the potential legal liability of the Soundscape product that is produced and
                        owned by Microsoft Corporation. Microsoft has taken great care to make sure
                        that Soundscape is not a legal liability risk. They have done this in several ways:
                        by use of waiver user agreements, by having the application avoid giving specific
                        instructions to the user, and by specifically cautioning the user to not use the
                        application as a primary navigation tool.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Part of the user agreement of Soundscape includes making the user aware that
                        they should not use Soundscape as a replacement for their primary navigation
                        method such as the use of a guide dog or cane. The user is made aware that they
                        are using Soundscape at their own risk and that they should not rely on the
                        Soundscape application in dangerous situations.
                    </p>
                       
                    <p>
                        Additionally, Soundscape is designed with safety as a high priority to minimise
                        legal liability risk. The application gives high priority to any situational
                        information related to traffic intersections and avoids giving specific instructions
                        to the user.
                    </p>
                    <p>                      
                        With our student project application, we simulate the Soundscape application in a
                        voice interactive environment and therefore mimic the safety features of the
                        actual Soundscape user experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Microsoft has gone further with liability limitation involving artificial intelligence
                        applications by publishing guidelines for responsible bots titled “Responsible
                        bots: 10 guidelines for developers of conversational AI”. These guidelines help
                        developers to avoid legal liability that may arise from behaviour of the artificial
                        intelligence algorithms that may be interpreted as contravening the United
                        Kingdom Equality Act 2010. Our project team is aware of these Microsoft
                        Guidelines and follow them in our application implementation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With regards to the Intellectual Property issues related to our student project, we
                        are governed by the UCL Industry Exchange Project Agreement which was signed
                        between our client (Microsoft) and our university (UCL). In addition, each of our
                        team members signed the UCL Student IP Assignment Letter. These agreements
                        were developed under the guidance of Graca Carvalho of UCL. Microsoft fully
                        owns the rights to the Soundscape application and we were not given access to
                        any source code of the Soundscape application. 
                    </p>
                    <P>
                        Our project involves creating a mock-up simulator of the Soundscape application,
                        which we created using various programming languages, Application
                        Development Interfaces (APIs) and Software Development Kits (SDKs) such as 
                        Ionic, Microsoft Azure, Node.js, SQL, Microsoft Cognitive Services, Microsoft
                        Language Understanding Service, Google Places, HTML Speech to Text API,
                        Bootstrap, CSS, JavaScript, HTML, Apple XCode along with various library
                        packages related to the languages were have used. We have fully complied with
                        all user agreements involved with the products we have used and are fully
                        compliant from an intellectual property standpoint.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        With regards to data privacy and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
                        now in effect in the UK, our project is careful to stay within the guidelines of the
                        law. Our application does store user data in a database. However, the data stored
                        is only the data required to enable the application to use machine learning to
                        provide useful suggestions to the user. The user can have their data cleared from
                        the application at any time and so no permanent data is retained about the user.
                        The data that the application stores is only what is legitimately needed by the
                        application for providing useful suggestions to the user during future interactions.
                        The data stored is not of the nature that the individual could be identified
                        personally by the data. No names or other such identifiers are stored in the Azure
                        database that keeps track of user interaction with the application. In addition,
                        the Azure platform is highly secure and will not be accessible via any other
                        means other than the application’s use of the database. The GDPR guidelines in
                        Article 5 regarding personal data are fully complied with by the Team 39 Student
                        Project application, “, “Artificial Intelligence/Deep Learning with Cortana” as well
                        as the Microsoft Soundscape application that it mimics. Personal data is
                        processed lawfully, transparently, and fairly. The data is collected for a specific
                        legitimate purpose that is explicitly declared. The amount of data collected is
                        only what is necessary and relevant and adequate. The data, by its nature, will be
                        accurate since it is machine generated from user behaviour. The data will be
                        retained no longer than is needed by the application to provide future
                        suggestions. The Azure environment proves security of the data to the level
                        appropriate under the GDPR.
                    </P>
                    <p>
                        One further data privacy feature provided by Soundscape and our student project
                        version is that user location is “ringfenced”. This means that the exact user
                        location is made less precise than the GPS technology would allow. In practise
                        this prevents a user’s exact location at exact times to be stored in potential
                        violation of the GDPR.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It should be noted that the application does not collect any information for the
                        purposes of marketing to the user or passing on the information to any third party
                        for any purpose. The data collected from the user behaviour is solely used to train
                        the machine learning algorithms so that the application can provide useful future
                        suggestions to the user based on the user’s past use of the application.

                There are only 7 clickable buttons and a text area in the App. All the buttons are blue and have white
                labels and icons. The text area at the bottom is white, to show some voice input or returned results.
            </p>
            <h5><b><font color="#4286f4">1. Instruction button</font></b></h5>
            <p>
                Users can click on this button to get some hints about how to use the App. The result will be a voice output.
            </p>
            <h5><b><font color="#4286f4">2. My location button</font></b></h5>
            <p>
                Upon clicking on this button, the App will tell the user’s location.
            </p>
            <h5><b><font color="#4286f4">3. Nearby markers button</font></b></h5>
            <p>
                Users can click on this button to search for the nearby markers they set.

            <h5><b><font color="#4286f4">4. Cortana button</font></b></h5>
            <p>
                This is the core part of this App. Users can always click on this button
                to send a command to the App. It is an alternate way to use voice to control
                the App instead of click on other functional buttons. When a user clicks on the
                button, the text on it will become into ‘stop’. And meanwhile, the app starts
                to record the user’s voice. After a user finishes speaking the command, click
                this button again to stop recording voice. Then the text on the button will
                become ‘Cortana’ again. After that, the user will hear the result and see the
                text format of the result in the text area.
            </p>
            <h5><b><font color="#4286f4">5. Around me button</font></b></h5>
            <p>
                Upon clicking on this button, the App will tell the user’s nearby places, such as restaurants, shops and banks.
            </p>
            <h5><b><font color="#4286f4">6. Ahead of me button</font></b></h5>
            <p>
                Upon clicking on this button, the App will tell the buildings or places in front of the user.
            </p>
            <h5><b><font color="#4286f4">7. Recommendation button</font></b></h5>
            <p>
                Users can click on this button to ask for some recommendation.

                    you need to contact any one of our developers to add you in the repository. Then you
                    can use git clone or download the zip file of the project. Then, you need to install
                    the latest version of the ionic framework and Node.js in your computer. Then open
                    terminal, change directory into this project folder(team39_Soundscape) then type
                    ‘ionic serve’ to open the App on localhost.
