            	 Over two million people in the UK are estimated to be currently living with sight loss.
            	 Almost four-fifths of these (79%) are aged 65 or over and most of the remainder are 
            	 working age adults. Only 1.3% of the VI population are estimated to be aged under 18 (1).
            </p>
            <p>
                More women than men are estimated to be living with sight loss (61% vs 39% respectively). 
                This is because women have a longer life expectancy on average than men, leading to a higher
                 proportion of women in the older age groups (i.e. those most affected by vision impairment).             
            </p>
            <p>
                Almost two-thirds (65%) of the VI population are estimated to be living with mild sight loss.
                This means that even with glasses or contact 
                lenses, people with mild sight loss can see as well at 6 metres as people with normal sight 
                can see at 12-18 metres; this population does not include the majority of the 45,000,000+ 
                people who wear glasses [2]. 22% are estimated to have moderate sight loss and the remaining
                13% are estimated to have severe sight loss.

            <p>
                The youngest age groups are more likely than the older to have mild sight loss (74% of those aged under 35 vs 64% of those aged 35+). This may be because many eye conditions are progressive, meaning that they become more severe over time.
                The size of the UK vision impaired population is projected to increase over time. As the graph below shows, the proportions of mild, moderate and severe loss are estimated to remain roughly consistent (3).

            </p>
            <p>
                The increase is driven by the UKâ€™s ageing population, with longer life expectancies leading to an increase in the number of people in the older age groups. As the graph below shows, these are the age groups with the highest prevalence of sight loss. The RNIB estimates that by 2050 there will be almost four million people living with sight loss (4).

                Microsoft Soundscape is a research project that explores the use of innovative audio-based technology to enable people, particularly those with blindness or low vision, to build a richer awareness of their surroundings, thus becoming more confident and empowered to get around. Unlike step-by-step navigation apps, Soundscape uses 3D audio cues to enrich ambient awareness and provide a new way to relate to the environment. It allows you to build a mental map and make personal route choices while being more comfortable within unfamiliar spaces.(5)

                    Our project was based on Soundscape and Cortana applications therefore our client was Microsoft with Jarnail Chudge as our instructor.Jarnail Chudge is innovation architect at Microsoft. He want us to use a scenario based approach to ensure the technical desgn and delivery has a real-world outcome. Key activities would include integration of Soundscape with Cortana. Jarnail Chudge has graduated from University of Warwick and he is leading the Cities Unlocked programme within Microsoft as a designer and solution architect. Therefore, he was the most suitable person to provide us with all the required information and solve any question that we had.

                   Microsoft is one of the most famous technology companies founded in 1975. It develops, manufactures, licenses, supports and sells computer software, personal computers and other services. One of the most popular products of Microsoft is its operating systems, the Microsoft Office suite, Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. Despite all these, Microsoft produces video game consoles.

                Our aim was to create an improved version of Microsoftâ€™s Soundscape that user would be able to use Cortana at the same time. Therefore, people with vision issues would be able to navigate through the app easily. Since our application is making recommendations according to userâ€™s overall behaviour the overall user experience is much better.
