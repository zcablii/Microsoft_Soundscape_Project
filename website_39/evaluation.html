                    <div>
                        <p>We use the Google Places API to provide a “Surrounding Places Search” service.
                            The result of places query can only be taken as reference information because
                            the information from this service may not up-to-date. Also, the accuracy of GPS
                            will affect the place query result. The places query results include: place name,
                            place direction and place a distance from the user’s current location. The place
                            direction is the approximate direction. For example, if the actual direction is
                            5 degrees West-Southwest, then the app will return an approximate direction as
                            West-Southwest. For place distance, we use Manhattan Distance [1] instead of
                            distance between two points of navigation route distance. In this case, the place
                            distance may not necessarily the distance the user has to walk from the current
                            location to their place of interest.</p>

                        <p>We use GPS service to get the user’s location coordinate (Latitude and Longitude).
                            Considering a single GPS point can be accurate up to only 15 meters, we cannot
                            guarantee the information we provide is very accurate. The completeness of map
                            and accuracy of GPS might bring a risk to blind users and so we will not give
                            users very specific instructions on where to go. Instead, we only provide approximate
                            information about user location and surroundings. For place distance, we use Manhattan
                            Distance [1] instead of distance between two points of navigation route distance.
                            In this case, the place distance may not necessarily the distance the user has to walk
                            from the current location to their place of interest. From the result of our testing,
                            the error is large at a high latitude. In the UK, the error is up to 35% because of
                            the sphere shape of the Earth. </p>

                        <p>We have integrated voice assistance inside the app which uses an AI algorithm.
                            The core parts of voice assistance are voice recognition and language understanding.
                            The user is advised that the voice assistance service is not stable or always reliable.
                            It just an alternative way for users to interact with the app. Users should not fully
                            trust or unthinkingly follow the results and users should judge the returned information
                            by themselves. To improve the intelligence and reliability of voice assistance, the
                            development team will keep training the service. So far, from the testing results,
                            the app can recognise the user’s speech in most circumstances. However, the app often
                            makes mistakes while the user is in a noisy environment. The recognition is also not
                            fully accurate when the user’s voice is to quiet or if the user has a heavy accent.
                            To reduce these errors, we have a message that asks the user to “please speak close
                            to the microphone and please speak clearly with as little background noise as possible”.

            <h4 class="service-heading" style="text-align: justify;">User Interface Design and User Experience</h4>
            <p>Our user interface has been finely tuned to the needs of visually impaired users. The buttons were enlarged so that the users could more easily see them. The positions of the buttons were optimised for clarity. For example, the  “Voice Assistant” button was repositioned at the bottom of the screen so that the thumb of the user could more easily reach it, as it is an important feature that we wanted to be always readily available so that the user never gets stuck not knowing how to do something they want to do.  For the same reason, the “Instruction” and “Recommendation” buttons were moved to the top of the screen because we expect that the user will be using these features much less frequently. All of these design decisions have drawbacks that come with the advantages. These features that we incorporated to make things easier for visually impaired users may make the application less attractive for users with normal vision. For example, we decided less animation and complexity to add clarity for the target users with visual impairment. These design decisions may make the application less exciting for users with normal vision. We also considered the colour scheme and decided that although we could make the application more “splashy” and eye-catching with the use of colour contrast, that this may make the application more difficult to read for users with colour-blindness or other similar vision problems involving distinguishing between certain types of colours. The blue chosen was optimised (as is the real Soundscape and the popular Facebook Social media application).
            </p>
            <p>For further work, we would need access to real blind users to conduct more extensive research into their user experience with the Soundscape Simulator ( for developing research suggestions for the actual Soundscape application ). During our User Experience testing in term 1, we interviewed several classmates to get feedback on their preferences as users of the application. However, this did not give us accurate suggestions as we had hoped.
            </p>
            <h4 class="service-heading" style="text-align: justify;">Functionality</h4>
            <p>
                Functions added in the Soundscape Simulator include voice interaction with the user and location awareness. The user is able to converse with the Soundscape Simulator as they would another human. They can speak to the application and it will understand what they want. The application will speak back to the user and give useful information. In addition, the application provides useful suggestions to the user based on their previous behaviour. These suggestions can be also based on the unique geographical location and time/date that the user is making a particular request. 
            </p>
            <p>Since the Soundscape Simulator is primarily targeted at helping blind and visually impaired users to navigate, the design of the user interface was done with a high focus on functionality in terms of which buttons would be easiest to activate if a user could not see the button but instead had to rely on the feel of the device and a general knowledge of where the button might be.</p>
            <p>The addition of Cortana and Maps gives the Soundscape Simulator application more functionality by allowing more information to be accessible to the user of the Soundscape Simulator (and the real Soundscape application if this new functionality is adopted).
            
            </p>
            <p>Further development of this new functionality ( voice interaction ) could include a deeper integration between the Soundscape application and the Cortana application. 
            </p>
            <h4 class="service-heading" style="text-align: justify;">Stability</h4>
            <p>
                The current Soundscape Simulator version is using the Ionic development framework. This allows us to prototype new features that could potentially be added to Microsoft’s Soundscape Application (for which we have not been given access to the source code of). It is expected that this implementation step (incorporating into the real Soundscape application) would have a high level of stability.
            </p>
            <p>Due to the research focus of our Soundscape Simulator, we are not as concerned about stability as we would be if we had created an application for commercial use. If we did end up pivoting our simulation application into a commercially viable application product to be made available to the public (independent and distinct from the real Soundscape application of Microsoft), then we would possibly consider rewriting the application in a native iOS environment rather than the current (more flexible) Ionic development environment.  The downside of this approach is that, when we extended the application to Android-based phones, we would need to re-write the code again for the new Java/Android environment. By staying with our Ionic Development Framework, we are able to develop for both iOS and Android environments more or less simultaneously. For the current project, we are focused only on iOS, so this will not be an issue for the foreseeable future.
            </p>
            <h4 class="service-heading" style="text-align: justify;">Efficiency</h4>
            <p>
                The Soundscape Simulator has a high level of efficiency in that it can interact with the user in real time and tell the user information about the location and surrounding points of interest. This efficiency is based on the integration of several well-functioning and well-supported API systems.
            </p>
            <p>As with the issue of compatibility, efficiency was not our primary concern when designing the Soundscape Simulator. The primary purpose of our Soundscape Simulator was to provide a platform from which we could test new features that would be attractive to visually impaired users. The features, if successfully adopted, would be deployed in the real Soundscape application of Microsoft. The deployed version, we can assume, would have optimal efficiency.
            
            </p>
            <p>One additional way to look at the efficiency issue is in terms of user experience. An example of this is the re-positioning of user feature buttons in order to make more frequently used functions quicker to find and push. This makes the user more efficient in getting the response they desire from the Soundscape (Simulator version or real version) application. The more efficient the application allows the user to be the more enjoyable the experience will be for the Soundscape user.
            </p>
            <h4 class="service-heading" style="text-align: justify;">Compatibility</h4>
            <p>Currently, the real Soundscape and the Soundscape Simulator are designed for the iPhone (version 6 and later) but the real Soundscape will soon be available for Android-based phones. Given that the Soundscape Simulator is built using the Ionic development-framework, an extension into Android phones should be quite feasible.
            </p>
            <p>Since we have developed the Soundscape Simulator application in the Ionic development framework, the application is very flexible in terms of being ported to other systems. The application can run in a Windows environment or a Macbook environment or with not too much modification, an Android environment. This makes the application highly compatible with a variety of devices and operating systems.
            </p>
            <p>Most of our research efforts were into designing the user interface and interaction mechanisms between the user and the application (simulating the real Soundscape). This makes the issue of compatibility less of a focus for us. If we were to need to make the system available in another format then we would not lose much or our investment of time and research since the user interfaces look and feel would still be the same. Visually impaired users would still be accommodated as well in any new system.
            
            </p>
            <h4 class="service-heading" style="text-align: justify;">Maintainability</h4>
            <p>Given that the Soundscape Simulator application relies on various Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), there is always the possibility that adjustments may need to be made to the application as regular maintenance. There will occasionally be changes that may break our system. We have seen some of these changes already and made remedial updates to the code to get the application back up and running. However, for our purpose of the software as a Soundscape Simulator, we are not as concerned about high-availability and scalability as we would if we were implementing the real Soundscape for deployment. We are mainly concerned with being able to simulate a new feature addition or modification of a feature and the effect this has on a user with a visual impairment. In our code, we have followed software engineering best practices (as taught in our term 1 module) such as Test Driven Development (TDD), modularity, cohesion and robustness. Together these design principles have enabled us to create a code base that is highly maintainable and flexible (in the case that new features can be “bolted on” later without any major integration issues). The use of the well-supported Ionic development environment also helps the Soundscape Simulator to be highly maintainable.
            </p>
            <h4 class="service-heading" style="text-align: justify;"> Project Management</h4>
            <p>Our three-person team worked well together under the leadership of Karolina. The project was managed smoothly.
            </p>
            <p>We had a combination of ways to work together that included our weekly scheduled lab sessions every Monday morning during term time. During the beginning few months, we also had an additional team meeting outside of our regularly scheduled lab. Our most important means of working together was via the Facebook Messenger chat application, which we used in a way similar to the way the Slack application is often used for project communication between team members. This allowed us to easily share files and plan meetings and get help with our individual tasks. This method was even very effective when we were travelling and not able to meet physically in London. In addition, we used a code repository on GitHub to keep track of code versions and changes.
            
            </p>
            <p>We were fortunate to be well-equipped by the UCL Computer Science Department Technical Support Group with various hardware that we required for our project. In addition, they gave us technical support on various network issues that arose.
            </p>
            <p>We were given access to a UCL-sponsored Azure account with credits by the lecture team of the module. We made good use of this account. Most of the software and APIs used were open source so there were no costs involved with this aspect of the project.

                    <ul>
                      <li><p>Extend the range of specialised topics that the application could assist the user with, such as nearby events coinciding with the schedule of the user or emergency information related to their current location.</p></li>
                      <li><p>Perhaps add a social media connection to the application that might allow the user to interact with other Soundscape users or features.</p></li>
                      <li><p>Adding Cortana integration features would be ideal but it would be difficult since we can only simulate the Soundscape application and integration with Cortana would require that we actually have the original Soundscape source code and Cortana source code to properly be able to test all the innumerable ways that the integration would need to be tested on.</p></li>
                      <li><p>We have learned about some regular meetups of blind computer users in London held by Apple. Attending these with our prototype Soundscape Simulator would allow us to get significant real feedback on the features we have implemented as well as planned features. This could also be a great source of new ideas for the new development of features and modifications to improve every detail of the Soundscape application.</p></li>
                      <li><p>With enough time, it may be possible to move the application from an Ionic framework to a native iOS framework. This may improve the speed performance of the application. This may also allow the application to be more smoothly converted to a commercial application if the Soundscape Simulator pivoted from being a simulator to being a stand-alone separate application based on a distinctly separate niche from Microsoft’s Soundscape application.</p></li>
                      <li><p>There are many additional Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that could be added to the Soundscape Simulator to increase its potential usefulness to users. Examples of these include LinkedIn API and the suite of APIs offered by Skype.</p></li>
